# Cryptocurrencies

Using a provided dataset with data on cryptocurrencies, an analysis was run to group the cryptocurrencies.

#### Deliverable 1

The dataset was preprocessed to fit the machine learning models and to be able to run PCA

#### Deliverable 2

The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm was applied to the processed data and the dimensions were reduced to three principal components.

#### Deliverable 3

The K-means algorithm was used to create an elbow curve using hvPlot to find the best value for K from the DataFrame created in Deliverable 2. Then the K-means algorithm was used to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrenciesâ€™ data.

#### Deliverable 4

The distinct groups are visualized that correspond to the three principal components that were created in Deliverable 2. A table was created with all the currently tradable cryptocurrencies.
